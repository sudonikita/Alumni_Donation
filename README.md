# Alumni_Donation

Alumni donations are an important source of revenue for colleges and universities. Understanding the factors that influence increases in the percentage of alumni who make a donation could help administrators implement policies that could lead to increased revenues.

Research shows that students who are more satisfied with their contact with teachers are more likely to graduate and give back to their alma mater. Another factor could be whether or not the university is public. The national ranking of the university could also influence the alumni to donate. Ivy league colleges have always had a high alumni donation rate and the state in which a school is located could affect the revenue as well.

This report quantifies the effect of the above-mentioned variables on the alumni donation rate. After exploratory analyses, a linear regression model is built and the flaws in the model are remedied with model diagnostic measures.
